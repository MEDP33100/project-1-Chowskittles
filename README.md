# MEDP 33100 Project 1: Interactive Storytelling

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to take users through the life cycle of a butterfly. 

Four images convey each stage: egg, caterpillar, cocoon, and fully-grown monarch butterfly. 

## Figma Design

LINK TO FIGMA: https://www.figma.com/design/hV0KPrX56Pb2FZzewVCiGM/Project-1?node-id=0-1&t=0jS5H9x6TOyUAtur-1
I listed the assets, layout of my page, and concept on Figma.

## Features

- List the key features of the project, including:
    - **Animations**: Images fading in, caterpillar moving side to side, and butterfly moving up and down.
    - **Sound Effects**: The ‘select’ sound effect from Pokemon when the ‘Next’ button is clicked, butterfly wings flapping when the butterfly stage is rendered.
    - **User-triggered Events**: The life cycle stage changing when users click ‘Previous’ or ‘Next’.
    - **Responsive Design**: I used flex design to accommodate different devices.

## Technologies Used

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Libraries**: GSAP
    - **Other**: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design

## Live Demo

- Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Credits

I used open-source images as well as these two audio bits from YouTube: ‘Select’ sound effect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UHmxWsPNzg
Butterfly wing flapping: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47XsTa6N7dE

## Future Enhancements

I would like to add more dynamic elements, or perhaps small butterfly images that follow the user’s cursor. More color and audio, as well.
